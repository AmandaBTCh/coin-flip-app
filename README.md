Coin Flip App
=================

This app simulates a coin toss.  There are two parts to a coin toss.  One party calls heads or tails and the other party flips the coin.  If the coin lands on the side that the one party called then that party wins.

The real purpose of this single page web app is to teach software engineering principles, design patterns, and some of it's methodologies.  This app is a multipart series.  The code should be simple enough that it doesn't muddy the water of understanding the engineering.
